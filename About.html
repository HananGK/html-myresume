    <h1>More about me</h1>
    <img src="./Resources/Hanan's Photo.jpg" alt="Hanan's Photo" width="125" />
    <p>My name is Hanan Gabarrón Kalito, I was born on the 10th of July 1999 (I'm 24) in Algeciras, south of Spain and I am mom of a beautiful 3 years old boy.</p>
    <p>Since high school I wanted to become a programmer but because of life circumstances I couldn't go to university to study the Software Engineer Degree and I didn't know about online courses so I became a Specialist Technician in Pathological Anatomy and Cytodiagnosis.</p>
    <p>Since I finished my studies I've been focused on doing courses on Pathological Anatomy, preparing for exams to obtain a job in the laboratory and raising my child. But I realised that it is very difficult to work from that and it is not what I wanted in life, so I'm studying to achieve my goal.</p>
    <p>So I'm actually taking an Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu to become a Full-Stack Developer and looking forward to specialize on Back-end.</p>
